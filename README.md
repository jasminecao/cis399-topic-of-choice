1. Tamagui
2. I've heard about this styling framework library and wanted to try some of its cooler features to see if it could be useful in a future project. The animations and ability to style web/React Native are interesting distinctions from other styling frameworks I've used.
3. I'll be following this [tutorial](https://tamagui.dev/docs/intro/installation) to get Tamagui set up and following their documentation on [animation](https://tamagui.dev/docs/core/animations) to make a simple animation.

I don't have a video, but see https://cis399-topic-of-choice.vercel.app/user/meek for a demo! If you click anywhere on the screen, Totoro moves to that position.
